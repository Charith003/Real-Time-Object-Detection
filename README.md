# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 deep learning models integrated with OpenCV. The system captures live webcam video and detects multiple objects with high speed and accuracy, displaying bounding boxes and class labels in real time.

# Features
Real-time webcam detection
Supports YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models
Fast and lightweight processing
Displays object labels with bounding boxes
Easy to modify and extend

# Technologies Used
